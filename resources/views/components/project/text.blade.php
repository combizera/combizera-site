  <h2 class="h2">Qual era o problema?</h2>
  <p>
    For three years, every semester, I used to stress about class planning. Figuring out which classes to take seemed like an impossible, convoluted task.
    <br><br>
    Through research, I discovered that this was not an isolated problem, but one that every university student faced. So I decided to automate this process and by building a machine learning algorithm that makes it easier for students to select and register for classes.
